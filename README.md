hdf5-cffi
=========

`hdf5-cffi` is a [CFFI](http://common-lisp.net/project/cffi/) wrapper for the HDF5 library. It does **not** provide a LISPy (= pretty) interface to HDF5. All it lets you do is to use HDF5 from Common LISP as you would from C. Not a pleasant sight, but hey, LISP is the *programmable programming language* (John Foderaro) and your imagination is the limit. For starters, have a look at Gary Hollis' [cl-ana](https://github.com/ghollisjr/cl-ana) package and then go out and do great things.
